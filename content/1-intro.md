## Tutorial

In this hands-on tutorial we are going to try several methods of reverse image searching

### Obtaining the image

Navigate to the link below:

[Amazon Listing For Blue Watermelon](https://www.amazon.com/QAUZUY-GARDEN-Watermelon-Seeds-Planting-Delicious/dp/B0BXCQ119V/) 


**Click** on the image of the blue watermelon so that box expands

**Right-click** or **CTRL-click** one the image and select **Open Image in New Tab**

Only the image should appear in a new tab in your browser window

**Right-click** or **CTRL-click** again on the image and select **Save Image As**

Select a location to save the image in an easy to locate folder on your computer, rename the file if you wish, and click save

Now **right-click** or **CTRL-click** once again on the image and select **Copy Image Link**


### Google reverse image search

If you are using the Chrome browser you can reverse image search using google via **right-click** or **CTRL-click** and selecting


### ImgOps

Navigate to ImgOps by clicking on the link below:

[ImgOps](https://imgops.com/)

ImgOps allows you to use multiple image tools at once, including 6 for reverse image searching.

**Click** on each link to the side of *reverse / similar*  including *google*,  *google2*,  *bing*,  *yandex*, *tineye*, and *reddit*

What information can you find from each reverse image search?

Do blue watermelons exist or is this misinformation?
